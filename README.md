Exercise 6: Packaging

This code provides a basic framework for pizza ordering system, demonstrating object-oriented programming concepts such as inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism. Each class has private/protected attributes with public methods to control access. Subclasses inherit behavior from abstract base classes. The MenuItem interface ensures all pizza components (PizzaCrust, PizzaSauce, PizzaTopping) have a getPrice() method.
